# 🧙‍♂️ Ergo-Guard: Posture Monitoring App

Ergo-Guard is a posture-detection web app built with **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.
It uses your webcam feed to analyze your neck, torso, and proximity angles — giving real-time feedback like:

✅ **Good Posture**
⚠️ **Warning (Slight Lean)**
❌ **Bad Posture**

The system helps users develop healthier sitting habits and can be customized for different thresholds.

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7949suraj/ergo-guard.git
cd ergo-guard
```

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux (bash):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 💡 If you face any issue with OpenCV headless builds, replace the line in `requirements.txt` with:
>
> ```
> opencv-python==4.8.0.76
> ```

## ▶️ Run the App

Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Posture Detection:**
   Uses **MediaPipe Pose** to detect body landmarks (neck, torso, shoulders).
2. **Angle Calculation:**
   Calculates the tilt and proximity of upper body joints.
3. **ML Classification:**
   Classifies posture as Good, Warning, or Bad based on trained thresholds.
4. **Real-time Feedback:**
   The Streamlit interface updates continuously with posture label and frame capture.

## ⚙️ Customizing Thresholds

You can modify the threshold values in `app.py` under this section:

```python
# Example thresholds
NECK_ANGLE_THRESHOLD = 20
TORSO_ANGLE_THRESHOLD = 15
PROXIMITY_RATIO_THRESHOLD = 0.8
```

Adjust these numbers if your camera angle or sitting distance differs.
